## About me
Hello All,

I'm Aryan Kadiya.

My name is Aryan Kadiya and pursing my Bachelorâ€™s Degree from Charotar University of Science and Technology and currently studying in Third year. I like knowing about human psychology and philosophy. I like to listen to songs.


Here is one poem by Joyce Alcantara which I find very inspiring:


- *You may see me struggle,*
- *but you won't see me fall.*
- *Regardless if I'm weak or not,*
- *I'm going to stand tall.*
- *Everyone says life is easy,*
- *but truly living it is not.*
- *Times get hard,*
- *people struggle*
- *and constantly get put on the spot.*
- *I'm going to wear the biggest smile,*
- *even though I want to cry.*
- *I'm going to fight to live,*
- *even though I'm destined to die.*
- *And even though it's hard*
- *and I may struggle through it all,*
- *you may see me struggle...*
- *but you will NEVER see me fall.* 







Have a nice day friend.
